# Purdue-Formula-SAE-
Software for Purdue Formula SAE's Modules

software you'll need to access anything:
m1 tune
m1 build
c125 dash manager
pdm manager
i2 standard (or pro if you have a license for that)

note: we've only gotten this to work on windows, so the rest of these directions will assume that you have a windows computer

download the software and then clear out everything in the folder C:\Users\$your_username]\Documents\MoTeC where $your_username is your account name on your computer. you'll be cloning the respository to this folder, so it needs to be empty. the repository is set up such that the motec programs will default to looking in the right folder for the config files/build projects/tune packages/data.

if you just want to download the repository, skip the paragraph about getting build to work. i should probably be more cautious about having this available to the public, but it's not like we're hiding any dark secrets in this repository. probably. don't worry about it. if you want to contribute to the respository, you're going to need a github account and a windows computer that can use github. if you have access to the link to join as a collaborator, use that. otherwise you can email me; just note that i'll ask you to prove that you're part of the team somehow. if you want to got the windows subsystem for linux route and set it all up for yourself, i'm going to assume that you know what you're doing or can figure it out. the easiest solution is to have the program "github desktop". it's a program that makes the task of using github on a windows computer a breeze. just download the program, log in, and then clone the repository. you'll need to set the folder to the folder specified above. it should start cloning everything to the specified folder once you're done.

everything besides m1 build should open up correctly when you open the correct file. for build, you'll have to install all of the updates before you can open the project. it'll take awhile, so please be patient.
