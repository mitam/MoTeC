notes on the various tunes

V000:
original dyno tune

V001:
Reduced ignition timing at 0% throttle for all RPM increasing from 10-26 degrees
Changed AFR to near 14.7 at 0 kPa for all RPM decreasing from 14.7 to 13.8
This was done to pursue a lower idle RPM

V002:
Increased AFR 10 a minimum of 12.3 and interpolated across entire range
This was done to return AFR targets to a more reasonable range 
12.3 was selected as purposeful overkill to retain saftey.
