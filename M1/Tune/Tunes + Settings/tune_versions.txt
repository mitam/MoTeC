notes on the various tunes

V000:
original dyno tune

V001:
Reduced ignition timing at 0% throttle for all RPM increasing from 10-26 degrees
Changed AFR to near 14.7 at 0 kPa for all RPM decreasing from 14.7 to 13.8
This was done to pursue a lower idle RPM

V002:
New base map estimate. Purposefully rich across range for saftey. Spark unchanged from V001
